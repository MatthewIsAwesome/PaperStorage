"# PaperStorage"

A system to encode files to paper and then decode them with a scanner
## System requirements
Python 3.X (Built in 3.6)
 - matplotlib installed (`pip install matplotlib`)
 - Python Imaging Library installed (`pip install pillow`)
Windows 10 (With Powershell)



## Event Log

tests with 0.5mm square sizes are promising

We could in mono options get 0.5mb on each side and with color this could be **trippled by using individual pixels as 3 with _cmyk_ color channels**

using matplotlib on decode ram issues are prevalent

Printer scans at 2480px X 3507px @300dpi


## ToDo

- [x] Start
- [x] Folder Structure
- [x] Start Work on Encode
- [x] Command Line based -s on Encode

- [ ] Start work on Decode
- [ ] matplotlib in automated system
